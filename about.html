    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Dignans is a premier outside catering company located in
      Edinburgh, known for delivering top-notch culinary experiences.<br>
      With five years of successful operation, we run our catering services
      out of a vibrant caf√©/brasserie.<br> Over the years, Dignans has built
      a strong customer base and established contracts with several local
      businesses and offices nearby. We also cater to individual clients for
      special events such as celebration buffets, often gaining new
      customers through referrals from satisfied clients.

      To date, Dignans has primarily relied on vehicle advertising,
      business cards, and local directories for promotion.<br> However, we
      are now ready to expand our reach within the Edinburgh district, for
      this we have launched this website. This website features
      comprehensive menus, a print option and a account system<br>

      Also, you can place simple and repeat catering orders via email,
      after registering your details. <br>The website will also promote
      monthly special offers.</p>
